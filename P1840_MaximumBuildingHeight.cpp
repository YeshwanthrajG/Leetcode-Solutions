Problem : Maximum Building Height

Statement : You want to build n new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and 
are labeled from 1 to n.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
The height of the first building must be 0.
The height difference between any two adjacent buildings cannot exceed 1.
Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions 
are given as a 2D integer array restrictions where restrictions[i] = [idi, maxHeighti] indicates that 
building idi must have a height less than or equal to maxHeighti.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear at most once in restrictions, and building 1 will not be 
in restrictions.

Return the maximum possible height of the tallest building.
